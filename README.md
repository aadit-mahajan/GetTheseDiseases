# GetTheseDiseases

if you wanna

5/4/2024 - update

- the realisation that some diseases might not turn up in the inverse comorbidities list       
- Inverse comorbidities can be divided into two broad categories:        
    - functional
    - genetic
- Finding the functional/metabolic inverse comorbidities can be done using the method we were using, but we might miss out on genetic comorbidities
- Finding genetic comorbidities can be done by analysing only the disease-gene network
    - can do clustering on the DG network
    - analyse the clusters and try to find the known relations for inverse comorbidities
    - find a logic to get to these relations through generalised code
    - Mine this network for further such pairs/relations once the logic for finding these has been established.
